# Sprout-IQ

**Sprout-IQ** is an intelligent agriculture bot that optimizes crop growth and delivers tailored recommendations using advanced sensors and machine learning. It is designed to automate and enhance soil testing and crop selection, addressing the challenges of traditional farming methods.

## Overview

Sprout-IQ automates soil testing, which is often inaccurate and time-consuming when done manually. By integrating sensors like temperature, humidity, and moisture sensors, Sprout-IQ continuously monitors soil conditions in real-time. The collected data is processed using machine learning algorithms, which recommend the best crops suited for the specific field conditions.

### Key Features:
- **Real-Time Soil Monitoring**: Collects data on temperature, humidity, and soil moisture levels to provide accurate insights.
- **Tailored Crop Recommendations**: Machine learning processes the sensor data to recommend the most suitable crops for each field.
- **Portable Design**: Designed to navigate rough terrains, making it perfect for both small and large farms.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Offers precise, actionable insights that improve crop yield, efficiency, and overall profitability.
